# ActualAssignment4
This is the correct assignment 4 submission.

Because git was already installed on my Linux machine and I already had an existing github account,
my first step was to clone my public repository using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/nic-lloyd/ActualAssignment4.git
```
My next step was to create and edit an HTML and CSS file using commands:
```
touch index.html
touch styles.css
vim index.html
vim styles.css
```
After editing my files, I pushed the files using the following commands:
```
git fetch
git add *
git push
```
